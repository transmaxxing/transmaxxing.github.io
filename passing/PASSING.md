# Passing as Female

> While it's significantly easier and in many ways better to be androgynous not fitting into the gender 
binary is going to make dating significantly more difficult. Thus you instead want to change your 
appearance to become as feminine as possible and this can include superficial traits such as hair and 
clothing. Boymoding for too long is a bad idea since then you are stuck being a feminine man which is 
very much inferior to being a masculine woman, at some point you need to transition socially. 
>
> Being on female hormones while trying to present as a male is probably not going to make your life 
easier, at least not short-term. If you are not willing to ever transition socially you probably shouldn't 
start HRT in the first place. The last thing you want to do is to half-ass your transition where you 
basically transition to nowhere in an attempt to deal with gender dysphoria or because you have some 
sexual reasons for doing so
