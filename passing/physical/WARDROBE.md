# Wardrobe

Transitioning from the drab world of guy cloths to the way more exciting and beautiful world of feminine cloths can be daunting! Here's some tips below, but also check out some amazing resources from [Pinkfemme](https://pinkfemme.com/category/style-and-fashion/) - they've compiled an incredible list of different styles and suitability for those pursuing a feminine transition. Some pages and content are linked here, but more is available at their site. Like it or not, some things just might not suit our body type - you will need to try it out and see what works for you. Think of this as part of the fun of femininity!

## Early Transition

As you start HRT you will have fat redistribution, and as you approach your [body goals](FITNESS) things might not end up the same fit for you even a few months down the line.

On a secondary note, women's clothing has an incredible variety of colors, textures, and patterns that aren't usually available in men's clothing. You can be overwhelemed at the choices and may make decisions on clothes that might not have lasting value. These clothes can be satisfying to buy in the moment or to wear once, but might not become a part of your everyday attire.

But what if you have a large collection of men's clothes? Well good news! Most men's clothing can be repurposed or upcycled into distinct feminine looks. T-shirts in particular can be simply cut to give feminine flair.

You can also style guy jeans by adding feminine flair such as strappy heels or sandals and a tucked in white or pastel t-shirt. [Boyfriend Jeans](https://pinkfemme.com/tips-and-tricks-to-make-boyfriend-jeans-look-feminine/)

> Sports bras can be a great tool for a transitioning woman. They offer compression (which might be required if boymoding) while also encouraging support for growing breasts. Sports bras shouldn't be the only bra you own, but they might be a good first! Some can even double as a cute crop to wear for the house or gym.

## Corsets

Corsetry can help your breast and butt look bigger by moving the soft tissue on your waist - giving your waist a thinner look. Check out the guide on [Corsetry](https://pinkfemme.com/starting-out-waist-training-beginners-guide-to-corsets/) from PinkFemme.

## Fitting to Your Body Type

### Broad Shoulders

Most transwomen will have a shape much like the inverted triangle - the relevant advice?

> The inverted triangle is when your shoulders or bust line is larger than your hips. In terms of numbers, you are looking at a difference of 5% or more. This is calculated by dividing your shoulder or bust measurement by your hip measurement.
>
> You are an inverted triangle if your shoulder or bust measurement is more than 5% bigger than your hip measurement.
>
> For example, if your shoulders (or bust) measure 36 inches and your hips measure 34.25 inches or smaller that will give a ratio of 1.05 or bigger.
>
>You are in good celebrity company as an inverted triangle with Cate Blanchet and Halle Berry. If you look at how they are styled you will see a theme of looks good on both of them.
>
> The signature piece that will always look great: Fitted jackets with a nipped-in waist and flared bottom.
>
> Why: The defined waist and flare over your hips will create the illusion of lower-body curves and help balance out your shoulders.
