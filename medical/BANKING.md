# About Sperm Banking

Sperm banking is also important for transwomen who are *considering* transitioning. This can be especially important for transwomen who have not yet undergone hormone replacement therapy, as the hormones used in this process can cause infertility.


Sperm banking is an important part of reproductive health for transwomen, as it provides them with the opportunity to have biological children in the future. Transwomen who are not able to produce sperm themselves, or who are not able to produce enough sperm to fertilize an egg, can use sperm banking to store sperm for future use. This allows them to have a family of their own, and it can provide a sense of security and control over their reproductive health.


Knowing that you have the option of having biological children if you choose to can help you to feel more secure in your decision to transition.

Generally speaking, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months for sperm production to resume to levels capable of having children after stopping HRT. This is dependent on individual characteristics as well.
