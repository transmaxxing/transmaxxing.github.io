# Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

> First off you need to raise your estrogen levels, there are several options for this (0 to 5). A high 
estradiol dosage will by itself suppress testosterone down to within the normal female range. Many 
people do however start on lower dosage resulting in high testosterone unless anti-androgen is used.

> You do not need official prescription to start on hormones in most countries, typically it's easy and safe 
to simply buy it at an online store https://diyhrt.cafe

## Anti-Androgens (AA)
> If your testosterone is high you might benefit from an anti-androgen, this however should only be a 
temporary solution since not having enough sex-hormones (estrogen+testosterone) will be bad for your 
health and this will be worse if it is prolonged and severe. There are cheap and effective options such as
"cyproterone Acatate" (up to 12.5mg/day) and bicalutamide (up to 50mg/day).

## Estradiol

HRT typically involves taking anti-androgens to block male hormones and estrogen and progestin to induce feminine characteristics. Common physical changes from this therapy include decreased body and facial hair, decreased muscle mass, breast growth, and softer skin.

See [About Estradiol](ESTRADIOL)

## Progesterone
> You may want to take Micronized Oral Progesterone if you are not on Cyproterone Acatate. The 
current recommendation is to add progesterone after 2 to 4 years.
dosage: 200mg Sublingual (under the tongue) or rectal QHS at bedtime
