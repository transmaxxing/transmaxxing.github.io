# Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)

> First off you need to raise your estrogen levels, there are several options for this (0 to 5). A high 
estradiol dosage will by itself suppress testosterone down to within the normal female range. Many 
people do however start on lower dosage resulting in high testosterone unless anti-androgen is used. 
>
> You do not need official prescription to start on hormones in most countries, typically it's easy and safe 
to simply buy it at an online store https://diyhrt.cafe

[TransFemScience](https://transfemscience.org/articles/) also hosts a wealth of information on HRT, including experimental treatments.

> Dont trust anybody that tells you the following "you are not a doctor so you dont have a right to read publicly available studies, and you dont have a right to open the dictionary and learn new words to understand the topic". That is a lie, you are a taxpayer first and you pay those scientists, they work for you in a way, so yes get into their stuff. Plus, you totally retain the human right to select a medical professional, and you do have a right to judge them, totally, absolutely yes. I do have that right.

You can expect results to begin in weeks to months - See [HRT Timeline](TIMELINE)

[Blood Testing](TESTING) is one indicator of HRT efficacy, but is not the only guidemark that should be followed.

Before you begin HRT, consider [Banking Your Sperm](BANKING) - even if you might not want to have children right now.

## Anti-Androgens (AA)
> If your testosterone is high you might benefit from an anti-androgen, this however should only be a 
temporary solution since not having enough sex-hormones (estrogen+testosterone) will be bad for your 
health and this will be worse if it is prolonged and severe. There are cheap and effective options such as
"cyproterone Acatate" (up to 12.5mg/day) and bicalutamide (up to 50mg/day).

## Estradiol

HRT typically involves taking anti-androgens to block male hormones and estrogen and progestin to induce feminine characteristics. Common physical changes from this therapy include decreased body and facial hair, decreased muscle mass, breast growth, and softer skin.

See [About Estradiol](ESTRADIOL)

## Progesterone
> You may want to take Micronized Oral Progesterone if you are not on Cyproterone Acatate. The 
current recommendation is to add progesterone after 2 to 4 years.
dosage: 200mg Sublingual (under the tongue) or rectal QHS at bedtime

Progesterone has been shown to promote the formation of Type II lobules in breast tissue. Type II lobules have 4x the number of milk ductules, and thus more mass/volume. The hypothesis is that Type I & II lobules form under estrogen/progesterone cycles during puberty, with Type I lobules forming primarily under estrogen cycles and Type II lobules under progesterone cycles.

Further cycling during pregnancy with progesterone matures lobules to Type III - mature breast tissue. This tissue is also [less susceptible to breast cancers](https://www.bcpinstitute.org/brochure---reproductive-risks.html#:~:text=Type%201%2C%202%20%26%203%20lobules%20are%20differentiated,female%20hormones%2C%20estrogen%20and%20progesterone%2C%20during%20menstrual%20cycles.). Type II tissue is also significantly more resistant to cancers than immature Type I tissue.
