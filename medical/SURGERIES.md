This is a rather sensitive topic but ignoring the harm done by these surgeries wouldn't be ethical at all, trying to sweep these things under the rug isn't helpful.

## Genital SRS

To a very large degree the issue is simply bad clinics/surgeons butchering people. Most SRS results you can find when looking them up online are very bad but there are a few exception.

If you look at actual studies you will find that it's not surgeries trans people benefit from. Only HRT 
has a significant positive association with quality of life in multivariate regression.

If your SRS is a failure there will probably not be any way to fix it later, it's irreversible.

The following study did found that the "mental health" metric increased temporarily after SRS only to 
fall back to the level it was prior to the surgery.

In-addition SRS generally require regular dilation, otherwise the pseudo-vagina will gradually shrink as
the body tried to heal.

Another option to consider is penile preserving vaginoplasty (PPV). This is mostly experimental.

## Orchiectomy
It is hard to see any real benefit with this when injections or ethinyl estradiol alone supresses testosterone enough to the level of castrated men.

This will also make you permanently infertile and thus the only way for you to have children will be via sperm you have backed up. [See About Sperm Banking](BANKING)

## Breast Augmentation
If you look at natural vs enhances breasts you will see a very clear difference, you can tell it's fake when it's fake (few exceptions) and it doesn't look right. A proper HRT regimen is effective in achieving mature breast development. If BA is desired be informed of the risks which include infection - which may even result in mastectomy. Proper surgical precautions are essential.
